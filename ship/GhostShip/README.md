# 🚢 GhostShip

**GhostShip** is the public mothership for white-labeled GardenOS apps.  
It carries projects like:

- **SpecGhost** – simple system spec & witness tool  
- **GuideGhost** – portable dev + education toolkit  
- **TrueGrowthLMS** – Learning + Life platform (pilot: OCCC)  
- **Mycelium** – connective growth layer

## 🌱 Mission
GhostShip exists to:
- Provide schools and communities with scalable white-label tools  
- Keep private Garden development separate and protected  
- Preserve dev history, rights, and IP for everyone who builds with us  

---

## 🎓 OCCC Pilot
The first pilot partner is **Oklahoma City Community College (OCCC)**.  
GhostShip is being tested as a way for students, faculty, and mentors to:  
- Connect through **TrueGrowthLMS**  
- Link life goals with academic progress  
- Explore AI in education responsibly  

This repo is where the journey starts.
